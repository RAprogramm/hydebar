## Customizing Themes

### Override Theme Colors

Start with a theme and tweak specific colors:

```toml
appearance = "catppuccin-mocha"

[appearance]
# Override just the primary color
primary_color = "#ff0000"
```

### Adjust Opacity

Make themes more or less transparent:

```toml
appearance = "nord"

[appearance]
opacity = 0.85  # More transparent

[appearance.menu]
opacity = 0.90
backdrop = 0.5  # Stronger backdrop blur
```

### Change Visual Style

Themes work with all styles:

```toml
appearance = "dracula"

[appearance]
style = "Islands"   # Default
# style = "Solid"   # No gaps between modules
# style = "Gradient" # Gradient backgrounds
```

---
